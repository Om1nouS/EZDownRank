Add 8 clickable buttons on each raid frame, their color change depending on health deficit, your spell power, and your mana.

## Buttons

- Buttons 1-4 (1st line) cast "Heal" from rank 1 to 4
- Buttons 5-8 (2nd line) cast "Greater Heal" from rank 1 to 4
- Shift click on Buttons 1-7 cast "Flash Heal" from rank 1 to 7

## Colors

- Buttons for cast rank that will overheal are transparent (but are still clickable)
- Green: highest spell rank with no overheal
- Yellow: no overheal
- Orange: not enough mana

## Example
